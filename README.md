# Weather Finder Challenge

We have a new client that needs to easily see the current weather conditions in various cities around the world. Our team has quickly built an MVP app and now needs your help to improve it.

Please see the following points where we think we need to improve:

- [x] Files and folders structure
- [x] Component size
- [x] Testing
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Logic coupling

Here are some bonus points:

- [x] Don't use classes
- [x] Use react hooks / custom hooks
- Use local storage to store the last search between sessions
- Use react context
- Use Error Boundaries
- Use Typescript
